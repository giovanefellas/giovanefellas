I'm Filippo, I'm from Italy and I like to code👨‍💻 especially in Pyhton!

I'm a Data enthusiast💭 I like to approach to the problem in the longest🏃, hardest🧗, but most complete way, I'd picture myself as a perfectionist👨‍🎨, although I'm not perfect😿.

I've got lots of repos, but they're all private, if you'd like to contact me, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipposansoldo/) or send me an [email](mailto:filipposansoldo@me.com)!
